 Project Overview
This project provides an **in-depth analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League)** data using **Power BI** to uncover insights related to player performance, team statistics, and match outcomes.

The interactive dashboard helps fans, analysts, and data enthusiasts explore:
- Team and player performance trends  
- Match results and season summaries  
- Batting, bowling, and win/loss patterns  
- Key factors influencing match outcomes  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze IPL data to track **team and player performance** across seasons.  
- Compare **batting and bowling statistics** to identify top performers.  
- Understand **venue-based trends**, toss outcomes, and match results.  
- Build a visually rich **Power BI dashboard** with dynamic filters and KPIs.  
- Provide actionable insights for sports analytics and decision-making.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
| KPI | Description |
|-----|--------------|
| **Total Matches** | Total number of IPL matches played |

## 🧠 Insights & Findings
- **Mumbai Indians (MI)** and **Chennai Super Kings (CSK)** are the most consistent teams with high win percentages.  
- **Toss-winning teams** have a slightly higher chance of winning matches, especially while chasing.  
- **Virat Kohli** and **David Warner** lead in career total runs.  
- **Lasith Malinga** and **Yuzvendra Chahal** top the wicket charts.  
- **Eden Gardens** and **Wankhede Stadium** record the highest average scores.  
- **Powerplay overs (1–6)** heavily influence match outcomes.  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Excel / CSV Files** – Raw IPL match and player data  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For calculated measures and KPIs  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **SQL / Python (optional)** – For preprocessing large datasets  

---

## 🧮 Sample DAX Measures
```DAX
Total Runs = SUM(Matches[Total_Runs])

Total Matches = DISTINCTCOUNT(Matches[Match_ID])

Win Percentage = DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Matches, Matches[Winning_Team] = Matches[Team])),
    [Total Matches]
)

Average Score = AVERAGE(Matches[Team_Score])

Top Run Scorer = CALCULATE(
    SUM(Players[Runs]),
    FILTER(Players, Players[Runs] = MAX(Players[Runs]))
)
